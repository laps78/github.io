## Project description

This is another little pet game project with a bit of adaptive layout. A Programming basics course diploma project.

The task was to make game logics in Javascript codes. So it's presented in one file. The project was built on [repl.it](https://replit.com/@IevghieniiLapt1/NETOLOGY-PB-diploma#index.html) and then transfered to my account on github.io.

So ou can view source code of this project aviable here if you want to.
